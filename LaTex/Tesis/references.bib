abstract = {T he nation's local jail authorities supervised an estimated 731,570 confined inmates at yearend 2013 (table 1). The number of confined inmates includes those who were unconvicted and awaiting court action on a current charge, convicted offenders awaiting sentencing, and sentenced offenders. Jail authorities also supervised about 9,670 persons who were serving a weekend-only sentence on the weekend prior to December 31, 2013. In addition, jail authorities supervised about 46,770 persons under community supervision through programs such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, day reporting, and work programs at yearend 2013. The population excludes persons supervised by a probation or parole agency. Based on a complete enumeration of all locally operated jails, the 2013 Census of Jails, which was collected through the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program's Annual Summary on Inmates Under Jail Jurisdiction, gathered facility-level information on the number of confined and nonconfined jail inmates. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1999, 2005, and 2006. In years between census collections, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected data from a sample of local jails to estimate the number and composition of inmates in local jails nationwide. This report uses the jail information from the 1999, 2006, and 2013 censuses to provide state and national level estimates and to examine changes in the number of inmates held, characteristics of jail inmates, the number of admissions, jail capacity to hold inmates, and jail staffing. By combining data from the census and annual surveys in noncensus years, BJS tracked the size and composition of local jails in the United States. After a surge from 1999 to 2008, the confined inmate population declined in local jails from midyear 2008 to yearend 2013 (table 2). The number of inmates confined in local jails increased 23{\%} between 1999 (605,943) and 2006 (748,197). Since 2006, the inmate population declined by 2.2{\%} (table 3).},

abstract = {After decades of steady expansion, state prison populations declined in recent years for the first time since 1972. Though the size of the decrease was small, it masks substantial state heterogeneity. This article investigates variation in state-level incarceration rates from 1980 through 2013, examining the factors associated with the rise and decline in prison populations. We find evidence for four key stories in explaining the prison decline: crime, budgets, politics, and inequality. Many of these relationships are consistent across decades, including the role of racial composition, violent crime, and Republican political dominance. In contrast, states' fiscal capacity and economic inequality became more important after 2000. This research emphasizes the importance of examining changes over time in the correlates of incarceration growth and decline and represents the first effort to systematically understand the recent reversal in the trajectory of incarceration practices in the United States.},

Independent variables included demographic characteristics, offense type, drug involvement, various neighborhood variables (e.g., concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility), and spatial contagion (i.e., proximity to others who become reincarcerated). Using geographic information systems (GIS) and logistic regression modeling, our results showed that the likelihood of reincarceration was increased with male gender, drug involvement, offense type, and living in areas with high rates of recidivism. Older offenders and those convicted of violent or drug offenses were less likely to be reincarcerated. For violent offenders, drug involvement, age, and spatial contagion were particular risk factors for reincarceration. None of the neighborhood environment variables were associated with increased risk of reincarceration. Reentry programs need to particularly address substance abuse issues of ex-offenders as well as take into consideration their residential locations.},

It has been made relevant by recent criminological theories, made possible by recent information technologies including geographic information systems (GIS), and made desirable because of innovative crime management practices. While focused primarily on the police component of the criminal justice system, the six papers provide a wide range of forecasting settings and models including UK and US jurisdictions, long- and short-term horizons, univariate and multivariate methods, and fixed boundary versus ad hoc spatial cluster areal units for the space and time series data. Furthermore, the papers include several innovations for forecast models, with many driven by unique features of the problem area and data.},

In a case study of Pittsburgh, PA, we contrast the forecast accuracy of univariate time series models with naı̈ve methods commonly used by police. A major result, expected for the small-scale data of this problem, is that average crime count by precinct is the major determinant of forecast accuracy. A fixed-effects regression model of absolute percent forecast error shows that such counts need to be on the order of 30 or more to achieve accuracy of 20{\%} absolute forecast error or less. A second major result is that practically any model-based forecasting approach is vastly more accurate than current police practices. Holt exponential smoothing with monthly seasonality estimated using city-wide data is the most accurate forecast model for precinct-level crime series.},

This study has attempted to relate the primary system goal of crime control to a set of policy alternatives distributed over each criminal justice sector. Specifically, a simulation model based on the techniques of “industrial dynamics” was developed to evaluate combinations of the following policies: speedy trial, no plea bargaining, and restricted bail. Data obtained from the District of Columbia's criminal justice agencies were used to validate the model. The results of the analysis indicate that the system is basically insensitive to small perturbations, but is susceptible to disruption from large changes in input and procedure. Under the given set of assumptions, continuation of current practices will lead to a gradual deterioration in performance that can only be stemmed by large expenditures on manpower and facilities.},

One derivative of the mathematical analyses is a proposed method for measuring the relative severity of sentencing in a given system. The second part of the paper deals with the criminal population as a whole, trying to bring into account the non-stationary behavior of the system.

The chapter describes how OR/MS has been used in studying crime and criminal justice. The correctional system has several goals: deterrence, education, retribution, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. The models relating to incapacitation are explored. The recidivism of an offender, his/her continuing to commit crimes, is a crucial factor in criminal career research. Deterrence is the reduction in criminal activity by the general public attributable to a given intervention. It is not associated with specific individuals, so it cannot be measured by tracing offenders' careers. Another area of importance to prison administrators is the projection of future populations of offenders. Operations research has also been used to study crime and how the police react to it. Problems related to juries investigated using operations research include the elimination of intentional bias in empaneling juries; considerations related to increasing bias in a jury by using peremptory challenges; and studies relating to the reduction of juror waiting time and the cost of empaneling juries. The systematic, quantitative thinking exemplified by these approaches to problem-solving has been very effective in helping to improve the administration of criminal justice.},

Increases in crime-prone groups in the population were not found to be associated with increased prison admission rates. Admission rates for the demographically disaggregated groups changed over time, and the pattern of changes varied depending upon the group examined. There was a relatively small growth in the prison population from 1975 to 1980, and over eighty-five percent of the growth could be explained by demographic changes. In contrast, from 1980 to 1983 there was substantial growth in the prison population, yet only 6.7 percent of the growth could be attributed to demographic shifts. Possible reasons for the pattern of changes found for the different age, race, and sex groups and for the large admission rate increases in the early 1980s are discussed.},

abstract = {Various stochastic models such as the transient and steady state versions of the infinite server queueing system are employed for the representation of the input-output dynamics of correctional institutions. These models determine in stochastic terms the ensuing prison population size that occurs after perturbations in the values of certain parameters have been made. The parameters are: the average inmate admission rate, the average time of incarceration, the elapsed time, and the initial number of inmates. The models' quantitative results are reported in the form of probabilities of intervals of two standard deviations about the mean of prison population size. Because of the models used, the prison population size is not normally distributed, nevertheless, it is shown that this random variable can be considered approximately normally distributed. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {The impact of state prison populations on crime is typically estimated by applying the lambda, the individual crime rate, of prisoners or arrestees. We outline the problems with this approach, attempt to reanalyze the widely divergent lambdas derived in past research, and make adjustments necessary to use lambdas for estimating the incapacitation impact. The result is an uncertain estimate of 16 to 25 index crimes averted per year per each additional prisoner. We argue that regression analysis can provide a better estimate of the impact of prison population growth. Applying the Granger test to pooled state data over 19 years, we found that prison population growth leads to lower crime rates but that crime rate changes have little or no short-term impact on prison population growth. Next we regressed crime rates on prison population and conclude that, on average, at least 17 index crimes are averted per additional prisoner. The impact is limited mainly to property crime.},

A model is developed for projecting: general population demographics; demographic- and offense-specific arrest rates, imprisonment probabilities, and times served; and then the size and composition of prison populations. Model parameters are estimated for Pennsylvania and are shown to be sensitive to demographic factors, particularly age and race. Projections of future arrests, prison commitments, and prison population are developed for Pennsylvania using projections of demographic changes in the state's population. Arrests are expected to peak in 1980, prison commitments are expected to peak in 1985, and prison populations are expected to peak in 1990, with the subsequent declines reflecting the maturation of the postwar baby boom children out of the highly crime-prone ages and, somewhat later, out of the highly prison-prone ages. ?? 1980.},

abstract = {Between 1975 and 2007, the American incarceration rate increased nearly fivefold, a historic increase that puts the United States in a league of its own among advanced economies. We incarcerate more people today than we ever have, and we stand out as the nation that most frequently uses incarceration to punish those who break the law. What factors explain the dramatic rise in incarceration rates in such a short period of time? In Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? Steven Raphael and Michael A. Stoll analyze the shocking expansion of America s prison system and illustrate the pressing need to rethink mass incarceration in this country. Raphael and Stoll carefully evaluate changes in crime patterns, enforcement practices and sentencing laws to reach a sobering conclusion: So many Americans are in prison today because we have chosen, through our public policies, to put them there. They dispel the notion that a rise in crime rates fueled the incarceration surge; in fact, crime rates have steadily declined to all-time lows. There is also little evidence for other factors commonly offered to explain the prison boom, such as the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill since the 1950s, changing demographics, or the crack-cocaine epidemic. By contrast, Raphael and Stoll demonstrate that legislative changes to a relatively small set of sentencing policies explain nearly all prison growth since the 1980s. So-called tough on crime laws, including mandatory minimum penalties and repeat offender statutes, have increased the propensity to punish more offenders with lengthier prison sentences. Raphael and Stoll argue that the high-incarceration regime has inflicted broad social costs, particularly among minority communities, who form a disproportionate share of the incarcerated population. Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? ends with a powerful plea to consider alternative crime control strategies, such as expanded policing, drug court programs, and sentencing law reform, which together can end our addiction to incarceration and still preserve public safety. As states confront the budgetary and social costs of the incarceration boom, Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? provides a revealing and accessible guide to the policies that created the era of mass incarceration and what we can do now to end it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the past several decades, the U.S. prison system has witnessed a steady and persistent increase in the ages of prison populations. Given the additional costs and burdens placed on prisons as they house older inmates, this aging trend has generated intense interest among policy makers and academics who seek to understand why prison populations are getting older. OBJECTIVE: This article presents a method for evaluating drivers influencing the change in age distributions among prisoners. METHOD: We define a methodological approach and demonstrate its application using prison data from four states reporting to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Corrections Reporting Program. RESULTS: We find that since 2000, the primary driver of overall growth in the elderly populations in prison (defined as inmates over 50) is the increasing admission age of offenders entering prison. Moreover, changes in offense mix and sentence length/time served over the last decade have had significantly less influence on the age composition of prison populations. We also find that the impact of explanatory factors varies across states and offense types. For example, prison admission and exit rates explain much of the change in elderly drug offenders in New York, but not elderly violent offenders, where admission age plays a much stronger explanatory role. CONCLUSION: Our analysis offers an effective demonstration that supports the use of this method as an important and informative first step toward understanding components of change that affect the problem of prison aging.},

Numerous examples using non-trivial data illustrate solutions to problems such as evaluating pain perception experiments using magnetic resonance imaging or monitoring a nuclear test ban treaty. The book is designed to be useful as a text for graduate level students in the physical, biological and social sciences and as a graduate level text in statistics. Some parts may also serve as an undergraduate introductory course.Theory and methodology are separated to allow presentations on different levels. Material from the earlier 1988 Prentice-Hall text Applied Statistical Time Series Analysis has been updated by adding modern developments involving categorical time sries analysis and the spectral envelope, multivariate spectral methods, long memory series, nonlinear models, longitudinal data analysis, resampling techniques, ARCH models, stochastic volatility, wavelets and Monte Carlo Markov chain integration methods. These add to a classical coverage of time series regression, univariate and multivariate ARIMA models, spectral analysis and state-space models. The book is complemented by ofering accessibility, via the World Wide Web, to the data and an exploratory time series analysis program ASTSA for Windows that can be downloaded as Freeware.Robert H.

abstract = {State and federal incarceration rates grew by over 200 percent between 1980 and 1996. The dominant factor is drug offending, which grew by ten times, followed by assault and sexual assault. The growth can be partitioned among four stages: offending rates; arrests per offense; commitments to prison per arrest; and time served in prison, including time served on parole recommitments. The growth in incarceration for drugs is driven most strongly by growth in arrest rates, then by commitments per arrest; there is some increase in time served, but only in the federal system. For other offenses, there are no changes in arrests per reported offense and a net decline in offending rates. Over the full period, the growth in state incarceration for nondrug offenses is attributable entirely to sentencing increases: 42 percent to commitments per arrest and 58 percent to time-served increases. Recently, new court commitments and parole violations have flattened out; the dominant contributor to current growth for all the offenses examined is time served. Incarceration rates rose faster for women (364 percent) and minorities (184 percent for African Americans and 235 percent for Hispanics) than for men (195 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (164 percent).},

Limited access to uniform national crime statistics and time-series data on crime-related socioeconomic factors makes explaining these trends difficult. Differences in the responses of states and territories to crime and lack of uniform court and prison statistics make identification of the factors underlying the risk of offending complicated.

Results suggest that the growth in prison populations has little to do with changes in crime rates or government response to citizen attitudes.

La th{\`{e}}se insiste sur l'importance des pratiques culturelles de la prison criolla - le mod{\`{e}}le carc{\'{e}}ral colombien d'origine - dans la mani{\`{e}}re dont a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} adapt{\'{e}} et fa{\c{c}}onn{\'{e}} le mod{\`{e}}le am{\'{e}}ricain de prison dans le contexte local. En se fondant, enfin, sur les ressources conceptuelles de Giorgio Agamben et Erving Goffman, les nouvelles prisons colombiennes sont d{\'{e}}crites {\`{a}} la fois comme un espace de contrainte, de d{\'{e}}possession et de contr{\^{o}}le sans pr{\'{e}}c{\'{e}}dent et comme un espace de r{\'{e}}sistance multiforme de la part de la communaut{\'{e}} des prisonniers."},

abstract = {La medici�n de las capacidades institucionales para el ejercicio de la salud p�blica es sin duda$\backslash$nun proceso prioritario que toda organizaci�n con funciones sanitarias debe emprender, y m�s$\backslash$na�n, cuando tiene una poblaci�n vulnerable a cargo. Es por ello, que la presente investigaci�n$\backslash$ntomando como base las directrices emanadas por la Organizaci�n Panamericana de la Salud y$\backslash$nlas realidades sanitarias de las prisiones colombianas, puso en consideraci�n su evaluaci�n$\backslash$ndentro del Sistema Nacional Penitenciario y Carcelario. Por lo tanto y para concretar esta$\backslash$nintenci�n, se seleccion� c�mo actor representativo al Instituto Nacional Penitenciario y$\backslash$nCarcelario ?INPEC-, en virtud a que esta Instituci�n tiene entre sus responsabilidades, la$\backslash$nadministraci�n de la pena, el desarrollo del proceso de resocializaci�n y hasta el a�o 2012$\backslash$ntuvo la rector�a exclusiva en materia sanitaria.$\backslash$nEn este marco y partiendo del enfoque de vigilancia en salud p�blica, se procedi� al$\backslash$nreconocimiento sanitario bajo un dise�o de car�cter descriptivo, que posibilit� caracterizar las$\backslash$nrealidades sociodemogr�ficas, epidemiol�gicas, higi�nico-sanitarias e institucionales que$\backslash$npresentaba el INPEC.$\backslash$nBajo este rigor y una vez finalizado este reconocimiento, se procedi� a medir las 11 funciones$\backslash$nesenciales, mediante el acceso a sus tres niveles de organizaci�n territorial, contando para ello,$\backslash$ncon los aportes de 8 funcionarios relacionados con la gesti�n de la salud p�blica intramural.$\backslash$nEn este respecto, la medici�n se desarroll� en la Direcci�n General, en la Direcci�n Regional$\backslash$nCentral y en el Complejo Metropolitano de Bogot�-COMEB ?La Picota?. De igual forma se$\backslash$nindica, que para instrumentar la medici�n se utiliz� la herramienta de la OPS, la cual fue$\backslash$najustada teniendo en consideraci�n las competencias, responsabilidades y campos de acci�n$\backslash$nque en materia sanitaria le concede el ordenamiento jur�dico a la Instituci�n.$\backslash$nComo resultado de ello, al final del proceso de investigaci�n se presenta una DOFA$\backslash$nsituacional que precisa los aspectos cr�ticos que desde la �rbita territorial y organizacional$\backslash$nlogran influenciar el presente y el devenir de la salud publica penitenciaria.$\backslash$nA nivel de conclusi�n, se evidenci� que los procesos y las acciones sanitarias dentro del$\backslash$n�mbito de prisiones presentan un conjunto de carencias y rezagos que son producto de la falta$\backslash$nde claridad a nivel de la rector�a en salud p�blica, as� mismo se identific� que el INPEC est�$\backslash$nsometido a un proceso de desinstitucionalizaci�n sanitaria debido a la transferencia de sus$\backslash$nfunciones y responsabilidades, que a la larga precisar� mayores obst�culos en la ardua tarea de$\backslash$ngarantizar la salud de la poblaci�n reclusa.},

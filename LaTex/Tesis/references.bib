abstract = {Multivariate Statistical Simulation Mark E. Johnson For the researcher in statistics, probability, and operations research involved in the design and execution of a computer-aided simulation study utilizing continuous multivariate distributions, this book considers the properties of such distributions from a unique perspective. With enhancing graphics (three- dimensional and contour plots), it presents generation algorithms revealing features of the distribution undisclosed in preliminary algebraic manipulations. Well-known multivariate distributions covered include normal mixtures, elliptically assymmetric, Johnson translation, Khintine, and Burr- Pareto-logistic. 1987 (0 471-82290-6) 230 pp. Aspects of Multivariate Statistical Theory Robb J. Muirhead A classical mathematical treatment of the techniques, distributions, and inferences based on the multivariate normal distributions. The main focus is on distribution theory{\^{a}}€”both exact and asymptotic. Introduces three main areas of current activity overlooked or inadequately covered in existing texts: noncentral distribution theory, decision theoretic estimation of the parameters of a multivariate normal distribution, and the uses of spherical and elliptical distributions in multivariate analysis. 1982 (0 471-09442-0) 673 pp. Multivariate Observations G. A. F. Seber This up-to-date, comprehensive sourcebook treats data-oriented techniques and classical methods. It concerns the external analysis of differences among objects, and the internal analysis of how the variables measured relate to one another within objects. The scope ranges from the practical problems of graphically representing high dimensional data to the theoretical problems relating to matrices of random variables. 1984 (0 471-88104-X) 686 pp.},

@book{Hardle2015,
abstract = {The second edition of this book widens the scope of the methods and applications of Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis. We have introduced more up to date data sets in our examples. These give the text a higher degree of timeliness and add an even more applied flavour. Since multivariate statistical methods are heavily used in quantitative finance and risk management we have put more weight on the presentation of distributions and their densities. We discuss in detail different families of heavy tailed distributions (Laplace, Generalized Hy- perbolic). We also devoted a section on copulae, a new concept of dependency used in the financial risk management and credit scoring. In the chapter on computer intensive meth- ods we have added support vector machines, a new classification technique from statistical learning theory. We apply this method to bankruptcy and rating analysis of firms. The very important CART (Classification and Regression Tree) technique is also now inserted into this chapter. We give an application to rating of companies. The probably most important step towards readability and user friendliness of this book is that we have translated all Quantlets into the R and Matlab language. The algorithms can be downloaded from the authors' web sites. In the preparation of this 2nd edition, we received helpful output from Anton Andriyashin, Ying Chen, Song Song and Uwe Ziegenhagen. We would like to thank them.},

abstract = {This textbook presents the design and analysis of experiments that comprise the aspects of classical theory for continuous response, modern procedures for categorical response, and especially for correlated categorical response. For any design (independent and matched-pair response) the parametric and nonparametric tests depending on the data level are given. Complex designs, such as, for example, cross-over and repeated measures, are included at an introductory and advanced manner. The problem of missing data is also handled with care and procedures in approaching this problem are proposed. Thus, this is an important resource/reference book for undergraduates and university teachers, for statistical researchers in the pharmaceutical industry, or other industries, as well as for clinical research in medicine and dentistry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe third edition contains a new chapter on incomplete block designs that includes the balanced incomplete block design and partially balanced incomplete block design in addition to the general theory on incomplete block designs. The chapter "Multifactor Experiments" is extended and includes new topics on confounding, partial confounding and fractional replications that are explained with examples. The more theoretical proofs of Chapters 3, 4 and 6 are put into an appendix.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nHelge Toutenburg is Professor of Statistics at the University of Munich.

abstract = {Preface This book evolved from material developed over several years by Anand Raja-raman and Jeff Ullman for a one-quarter course at Stanford. The course CS345A, titled " Web Mining, " was designed as an advanced graduate course, although it has become accessible and interesting to advanced undergraduates. When Jure Leskovec joined the Stanford faculty, we reorganized the material considerably. He introduced a new course CS224W on network analysis and added material to CS345A, which was renumbered CS246. The three authors also introduced a large-scale data-mining project course, CS341. The book now contains material taught in all three courses. What the Book Is About At the highest level of description, this book is about data mining. However, it focuses on data mining of very large amounts of data, that is, data so large it does not fit in main memory. Because of the emphasis on size, many of our examples are about the Web or data derived from the Web. Further, the book takes an algorithmic point of view: data mining is about applying algorithms to data, rather than using data to " train " a machine-learning engine of some sort. The principal topics covered are: 1. Distributed file systems and map-reduce as a tool for creating parallel algorithms that succeed on very large amounts of data.},

abstract = {Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of firms in many different industries. As these firms collect an increasing amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting churn. In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a "Churn Score" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large mobile phone network, our method identifies several intuitive - and a few surprising - early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {This study examines the use of social network information for customer churn prediction. An alternative modeling approach using relational learning algorithms is developed to incorporate social network effects within a customer churn prediction setting, in order to handle large scale networks, a time dependent class label, and a skewed class distribution. An innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers and a novel parallel modeling setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model are introduced. The results of two real life case studies on large scale telco data sets are presented, containing both networked (call detail records) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. A significant impact of social network effects, including non-Markovian effects, on the performance of a customer churn prediction model is found, and the parallel model setup is shown to boost the profits generated by a retention campaign. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Customer retention in telecommunication companies is one of the most important issues in customer relationship management, and customer churn prediction is a major instrument in customer retention. Churn prediction aims at identifying potential churning customers. Traditional approaches for determining potential churning customers are based only on customer personal information without considering the relationship among customers. However, the subscribers of telecommunication companies are connected with other customers, and network properties among people may affect the churn. For this reason, we proposed a new procedure of the churn prediction by examining the communication patterns among subscribers and considering a propagation process in a network based on call detail records which transfers churning information from churners to non-churners. A fast and effective propagation process is possible through community detection and through setting the initial energy of churners (the amount of information transferred) differently in churn date or centrality. The proposed procedure was evaluated based on the performance of the prediction model trained with a social network feature and traditional personal features. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the second phase, the performance improvement offered by boosting was studied. In order to determine the most efficient parameter combinations we performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations for each method and for a wide range of parameters. Our results demonstrate clear superiority of the boosted versions of the models against the plain (non-boosted) versions. The best overall classifier was the SVM-POLY using AdaBoost with accuracy of almost 97{\%} and F-measure over 84{\%}.},

There is a need for a model that simulates how offenders are admitted, how they move in and out of the system, and how capable it is of answering “what if ” type of questions.

abstract = {Background: For the past several decades, the U.S. prison system has witnessed a steady and persistent increase in the ages of prison populations. Given the additional costs and burdens placed on prisons as they house older inmates, this aging trend has generated intense interest among policy makers and academics who seek to understand why prison populations are getting older. Objective: This article presents a method for evaluating drivers influencing the change in age distributions among prisoners. Method: We define a methodological approach and demonstrate its appli-cation using prison data from four states reporting to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Corrections Reporting Program. Results: We find that since 2000, the primary driver of overall growth in the elderly populations in prison (defined as inmates over 50) is the increasing admission age of offenders entering prison. Moreover, changes in offense mix and sentence length/time served over the last decade have had significantly less influence on the age composition of prison populations. We also find that the impact of explanatory factors varies across states and offense types. For example, prison admission and exit rates explain much of the change in elderly drug offenders in New York, but not elderly violent offenders, where admission age plays a much stronger explanatory role. Conclusion: Our analysis offers an effective demonstration that supports the use of this method as an important and informative first step toward understanding components of change that affect the problem of prison aging.},

abstract = {The 2012 Doha meeting established the continuation of the Kyoto protocol, the legally-binding global agreement under which signatory countries had agreed to reduce their carbon emissions. Contrary to this assumed obligation, all G20 countries with the exception of France and the UK saw significant increases in their CO2 emissions over the last 25 years, surpassing 300{\%} in the case of China. This paper attempts to forecast the evolution of carbon dioxide emissions in Bahrain over the 2012–2021 decade by employing seven Automated Forecasting Methods, including the exponential smoothing state space model (ETS), the Holt–Winters Model, the BATS/TBATS model, ARIMA, the structural time series model (STS), the naive model, and the neural network time series forecasting method (NNAR). Results indicate a reversal of the current decreasing trend of pollution in the country, with a point estimate of 2309 metric tons per capita at the end of 2020 and 2317 at the end of 2021, as compared to the 1934 level achieved in 2010. The country's baseline level corresponding to year 1990 (as specified by the Doha amendment of the Kyoto protocol) is approximately 25.54 metric tons per capita, which implies a maximum level of 20.96 metric tons per capita for the year 2020 (corresponding to a decrease of 18{\%} relative to the baseline level) in order for Bahrain to comply with the protocol. Our results therefore suggest that Bahrain cannot meet its assumed target.},

abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

We first provide some background on the history of state space methods for the analysis of time series. This is followed by a concise overview of linear Gaussian state space analysis including the modelling framework and appropriate estimation methods. We discuss the important class of unobserved component models which incorporate a trend, a seasonal, a cycle, and fixed explanatory and intervention variables for the univariate and multi-variate analysis of time series. We continue the discussion by presenting methods for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state vector: filtering, prediction, and smoothing. Estimation approaches for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next, we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for construct-ing confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also provide a basic introduction for non-Gaussian state space models. Finally, we present an overview of the software tools currently available for the analysis of time series with state space methods as they are discussed in the other contri-butions to this special volume.},

abstract = {By using a binomial logit model based on a survey of 973 mobile users in Korea, the determinants of subscriber churn and customer loyalty are identified in the Korean mobile telephony market. The probability that a subscriber will switch carrier is dependent on the level of satisfaction with alternative-specific service attributes including call quality, tariff level, handsets, brand image, as well as income, and subscription duration. However, only factors such as call quality, handset type, and brand image affect customer loyalty as measured by the intention/non-intention to recommend the service provider to other people. The insignificance of subscription duration in affecting the loyalty-induced action indicates that lock-in effects are likely to be concentrated among the ''spuriously loyal'' customers who are not willing to churn just because of switching costs. These findings provide implications for the mobile business as well as competition policies for the mobile telephony market. r},

Using customer transaction and billing data, this study investigates determinants of customer churn in the Korean mobile telecommunications service market. Results indicate that call quality-related factors influence customer churn; however, customers participating in membership card programs are also more likely to churn, which raises questions about program effectiveness. Furthermore, heavy users also tend to churn. In order to analyze partial and total defection, this study defines changes in a customer's status from active use (using the service on a regular basis) to non-use (deciding not to use it temporarily without having churned yet) or suspended (being suspended by the service provider) as partial defection and from active use to churn as total defection. Thus, mediating effects of a customer's partial defection on the relationship between the churn determinants and total defection are analyzed and their implications are discussed. Results indicate that some churn determinants influence customer churn, either directly or indirectly through a customer's status change, or both; therefore, a customer's status change explains the relationship between churn determinants and the probability of churn. r},

A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a speci{\textregistered}c prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classi{\textregistered}er class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference, the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory. q},

Compared to Logistic Regression, GAM relaxes the linearity constraint which allows for complex non-linear fits to the data. The contributions to the literature are three-fold: (i) it is shown that GAM is able to improve marketing decision making by better identifying risky customers; (ii) it is shown that GAM increases the interpretability of the churn model by visualizing the non-linear relationships with customer churn identifying a quasi-exponential, a U, an inverted U or a complex trend and (iii) marketing managers are able to significantly increase business value by applying GAM in this churn prediction context.},

abstract = {In an era of strong customer relationship management (CRM) emphasis, firms strive to build valuable relationships with their existing customer base. In this study, we attempt to better understand three important measures of customer outcome: next buy, partial-defection and customers' profitability evolution. By means of random forests techniques we investigate a broad set of explanatory variables, including past customer behavior, observed customer heterogeneity and some typical variables related to intermediaries. We analyze a real-life sample of 100,000 customers taken from the data warehouse of a large European financial services company. Two types of random forests techniques are employed to analyze the data: random forests are used for binary classification, whereas regression forests are applied for the models with linear dependent variables. Our research findings demonstrate that both random forests techniques provide better fit for the estimation and validation sample compared to ordinary linear regression and logistic regression models. Furthermore, we find evidence that the same set of variables have a different impact on buying versus defection versus profitability behavior. Our findings suggest that past customer behavior is more important to generate repeat purchasing and favorable profitability evolutions, while the intermediary's role has a greater impact on the customers' defection proneness. Finally, our results demonstrate the benefits of analyzing different customer outcome variables simultaneously, since an extended investigation of the next buy–partial-defection–customer profitability triad indicates that one cannot fully understand a particular outcome without understanding the other related behavioral outcome variables.},

abstract = {The enhancement of existing relationships is of pivotal importance to companies, since attracting new customers is known to be more expensive. Therefore, as part of their customer relationship management (CRM) strategy, many researchers have been analyzing 'why' customers decide to switch. However, despite its practical relevance, few studies have investigated how companies can react to defection prone customers by offering the right set of products. Additionally, within the current customer attention 'hype', one tends to overlook the nature of different products when investigating customer defection. In this research, we study the defection of the savings and investment (SI) customers of a large Belgian financial service provider. We created different SI churn behavior categories by introducing two dimensions: (i) duration of the products (fixed term versus infinity) and (ii) capital/revenue risks involved. Considering these product features, we first gain explorative insight in the timing of the churn event by means of Kaplan – Meier estimates. Secondly, we elaborate on the most alarming group of customers that emerged from the former explorative analysis. A hazard model is built to detect the most convenient product categories to cross-sell in order to reduce their churn likelihood. Complementary, a multinomial probit model is estimated to explore the customers' preferences with respect to the product features involved and to test whether these correspond with the findings of the survival analysis. The results of our study indicate that customer retention cannot be understood by solely relying on customer characteristics. In sum, it might be true that 'not all customers are created equal', but neither are all products. q},

A model is developed for projecting: general population demographics; demographic- and offense-specific arrest rates, imprisonment probabilities, and times served; and then the size and composition of prison populations. Model parameters are estimated for Pennsylvania and are shown to be sensitive to demographic factors, particularly age and race. Projections of future arrests, prison commitments, and prison population are developed for Pennsylvania using projections of demographic changes in the state's population. Arrests are expected to peak in 1980, prison commitments are expected to peak in 1985, and prison populations are expected to peak in 1990, with the subsequent declines reflecting the maturation of the postwar baby boom children out of the highly crime-prone ages and, somewhat later, out of the highly prison-prone ages. ?? 1980.},

The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system.

Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t International new ventures (INVs) face constant competitive intensity, which serves to increase the already high difficulty of enhancing marketing capabilities to gain superior performance in foreign markets. International en-trepreneurship (IE) literature suggests that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) may influence INVs' performance. However, EO can be a resource-consuming strategic orientation, and INVs face resource constraints. Specifically, the literature expresses doubts as to whether increasing levels of EO are favorable for all INVs, all the time. From the resource-based view (RBV) perspective, the present paper extends previous IE research by investigating whether the degree to which EO and corresponding marketing capabilities vary under differing competitive intensities when enhancing performance. The findings highlight the moderating role of competitive intensity between EO and marketing capabilities for better INV performance. These have important implications for the decisions of IE scholars and practitioners about EO allocation in order to enhance the required marketing capabil-ities for INV's increased performance. The survey data consist of Mexican INVs, where the emphasis on constrained resources is high as are the compet-itive intensity challenges that these firms face in foreign markets. Therefore, this study contributes to the almost wholly ignored research about Latin American new venture internationalization and performance debate.},

abstract = {Introduction Black male youth are at high risk of homicide and criminal justice involvement. This study aimed to determine how early mortality among youth offenders varies based on race; gender; and the continuum of justice system involvement: arrest, detention, incarceration, and transfer to adult courts. Methods Criminal and death records of 49,479 youth offenders (ages 10-18 years at first arrest) in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2011, were examined. Statistical analyses were completed in November 2014. Results From 1999 to 2011 (aggregate exposure, 386,709 person-years), 518 youth offender deaths occurred. The most common cause of death was homicide (48.2{\%}). The mortality rate of youth offenders was nearly 1.5 times greater than that among community youth (standardized mortality ratio, 1.48). The youth offender mortality rate varied depending on the severity of justice system involvement. Arrested youth had the lowest rate of mortality (90/100,000), followed by detained youth (165/100,000); incarcerated youth (216/100,000); and youth transferred to adult court (313/100,000). A proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age, male gender, and more severe justice system involvement 5 years post-arrest predicted shorter time to mortality. Conclusions Youth offenders face greater risk for early death than community youth. Among these, black male youth face higher risk of early mortality than their white male counterparts. However, regardless of race/ethnicity, mortality rates for youth offenders increase as youth involvement in the justice system becomes more protracted and severe. Thus, justice system involvement is a significant factor to target for intervention.},

abstract = {Most marketers have difficulty in identifying the right customers to engage in successful campaigns. So far, customer segmentation is a popular method that is used for selecting appropriate customers for a launch campaign. Unfortunately, the link between customer segmentation and marketing campaign is missing. Another problem is that database marketers generally use different models to conduct customer segmentation and customer targeting. This study presents a novel approach that combines customer targeting and customer segmentation for campaign strategies. This investigation identifies customer behavior using a recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) model and then uses a customer life time value (LTV) model to evaluate proposed segmented customers. Additionally, this work proposes using generic algorithm (GA) to select more appropriate customers for each campaign strategy. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, this work performs an empirical study of a Nissan automobile retailer to segment over 4000 customers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can more effectively target valuable customers than random selection.},

abstract = {With the advent of one-to-one marketing media, e.g. targeted direct mail or internet marketing, the opportunities to develop targeted marketing (customer relationship management) campaigns are enhanced in such a way that it is now both organizationally and economically feasible to profitably support a substantially larger number of marketing segments. However, the problem of what segments to distinguish, and what actions to take towards the different segments increases substantially in such an environment. A systematic analytic procedure optimizing both steps would be very welcome. In this study, we present a joint optimization approach addressing two issues: (1) the segmentation of customers into homogeneous groups of customers, (2) determining the optimal policy (i.e. what action to take from a set of available actions) towards each segment. We implement this joint optimization framework in a direct-mail setting for a charitable organization. Many previous studies in this area highlighted the importance of the following variables: R(ecency), F(requency), and M(onetary value). We use these variables to segment customers. In a second step, we determine which marketing policy is optimal using markov decision processes, following similar previous applications. The attractiveness of this stochastic dynamic programming procedure is based on the long-run maximization of expected average profit. Our contribution lies in the combination of both steps into one optimization framework to obtain an optimal allocation of marketing expenditures. Moreover, we control segment stability and policy performance by a bootstrap procedure. Our framework is illustrated by a real-life application. The results show that the proposed model outperforms a CHAID segmentation.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers based on their value. After segmenting customers based on their value, strategies building according to customer segment will be illustrated through a case study on a wireless telecommunication company.},

abstract = {Since the early 1980s, the concept of relationship management in marketing area has gained its importance. Acquiring and retaining the most profitable customers are serious concerns of a company to perform more targeted marketing campaigns. For effective customer relationship management, it is important to gather information on customer value. Many researches have been performed to calculate customer value based on Customer lifetime value (LTV). It, however, has some limitations. It is difficult to consider the defection of customers. Prediction models have focused mainly on expected future cash flow derived from customers' past profit contribution. In this paper we suggest an LTV model considering past profit contribution, potential benefit, and defection probability of a customer. We also cover a framework for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers based on their value. Customer value is classified into three categories: current value, potential value, and customer loyalty. Customers are segmented according to three types of customer value. A case study on calculating customer value and segmenting customers of a wireless communication company will be illustrated.},

We use state-level decennial data from 1970 to 2010 (N = 250) to test whether recent theoretical models derived from historical research that emphasize the importance of specific historical periods in shaping the relative importance of certain social and political factors explain imprisonment. Also drawing on historical work, we examine how these key determinants differed in Sunbelt states, that is, the states stretching across the nation's South from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific, from the rest of the nation. Our findings suggest that the relative contributions of violent crime, minority composition, political ideology, and partisanship to imprisonment vary over time. We also extend our analysis beyond mass incarceration's rise to analyze how factors associated with prison expansion can explain its stabilization and contraction in the early twenty-first century. Our findings suggest that most of the factors that best explained state incarceration rates in the prison boom era lost power once imprisonment stabilized and declined. We find considerable support for the importance of historical contingencies in shaping state-level imprisonment trends, and our findings highlight the enduring importance of race in explaining incarceration.},

Global cross-country regressions of crime and incarcer- ation on background characteristics explain much of the variation between other countries. But the estimated models predict only one-fourth of U.S. incarceration and not all ofU.S. crime. The coincidence of the non-negativeU.S. crime residuals with the very large positive U.S. incarceration residual constitutes a puzzle. The two pieces fit together only if the residual U.S. incarceration does not contribute to a reduction in crime, except to the extent an omitted criminogenic factor pushes up U.S. crime. The paper quantifies this relationship. Drawing on additional evidence from comparative and U.S.-specific data, it argues that the puzzle's most plausible solution combines low effectiveness of mass incarceration with omitted criminogenic factors such as U.S. neighborhood segregation.},

This article poses an explanation for this seeming paradox, drawing on measures of implicit racial affect in a nationally representative survey to reveal a persisting relevance of racial bias in understandings of and support for public policies—even among those explicitly denying such bias. Among non-Hispanic whites, implicit racial bias is significantly associated with opposition to policies designed to ameliorate these inequalities as well as support for punitive crime policies. Racial bias appears to play a less important role in support or opposition to these policies among Hispanic whites and especially among African-Americans. Implications for public policy debates are discussed.},

abstract = {Addressing the health status and needs of incarcerated youth represents an issue at the nexus of juvenile justice reform and health care reform. Incarcerated youth face disproportionately higher morbidity and higher mortality compared to the general adolescent population. Dental health, reproductive health, and mental health needs are particularly high, likely as a result of lower access to care, engagement in high-risk behaviors, and underlying health disparities. Violence exposure and injury also contribute to the health disparities seen in this population. Further, juvenile incarceration itself is an important determinant of health. Juvenile incarceration likely correlates with worse health and social functioning across the life course. Correctional health care facilities allow time for providers to address the unmet physical and mental health needs seen in this population. Yet substantial challenges to care delivery in detention facilities exist and quality of care in detention facilities varies widely. Community-based pediatricians can serve a vital role in ensuring continuity of care in the postdetention period and linking youth to services that can potentially prevent juvenile offending. Pediatricians who succeed in understanding and addressing the underlying social contexts of their patients' lives can have tremendous impact in improving the life trajectories of these vulnerable youth. Opportunities exist in clinical care, research, medical education, policy, and advocacy for pediatricians to lead change and improve the health status of youth involved in the juvenile justice system.},

Consistent with prior research, findings show that larger Black populations are associated with higher incarceration rates but that this association has weakened over time. Results also indicate that determinate sentencing is associated with lower imprisonment rates. The interaction between a higher proportion of African American residents and determinate sentencing, however, is associated with higher incarceration rates, suggesting that in states with greater minority presence the abolition of discretionary parole amplifies the impact of punitive responses linked to racial threat. It is argued that this unintended effect reflects the fact that formal constraints on release decision making reduce the ability of justice systems to administer greater punishments to specific subpopulations.},

Narrative and meta-analytic reviews have indicated that race/ethnicity influences key sentencing outcomes, at least under certain conditions. This research relies almost exclusively on regression-based analyses for determining race and ethnicity effects. While this technique is useful, recent statistical advances may provide more accurate race/ethnicity estimates. The current study employs propensity score analysis to compare punishment outcomes across White, Black, and Hispanic offenders sentenced in US federal courts during the years 2006 through 2008. Results suggest that (a) during the in/out decision the effect of minority status is frequently smaller than that estimated by regression modeling and (b) during the sentence length decision the effect of minority status is frequently larger than that estimated by regression modeling. Consequently, the modeling strategy may produce different conclusions regarding the presence of race- and ethnic-based disparity in sentencing outcomes.},

The analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime control politics and policies at the national level that reflected historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.},

abstract = {This Article presents new empirical evidence concerning the effects of United States v. Booker, which loosened the formerly mandatory U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, on racial disparities in federal criminal cases. Two serious limitations pervade existing empirical literature on sentencing disparities. First, studies focus on sentencing in isolation, controlling for the "presumptive sentence" or similar measures that themselves result from discretionary charging, plea-bargaining, and fact-finding processes. Any disparities in these earlier processes are excluded from the resulting sentence-disparity estimates. Our research has shown that this exclusion matters: pre-sentencing decision-making can have substantial sentence-disparity consequences. Second, existing studies have used loose causal inference methods that fail to disentangle the effects of sentencing-law changes, such as Booker, from surrounding events and trends. In contrast, we use a dataset that traces cases from arrest to sentencing, allowing us to assess Booker's effects on disparities in charging, plea-bargaining, and fact-finding, as well as sentencing. We disentangle background trends by using a rigorous regression discontinuity-style design. Contrary to other studies (and in particular, the dramatic recent claims of the U.S. Sentencing Commission), we find no evidence that racial disparity has increased since Booker, much less because of Booker. Unexplained racial disparity remains persistent, but does not appear to have increased following the expansion of judicial discretion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for consumer credit scoring, by tailoring a profit-based classification performance measure to credit risk modeling. This performance measure takes into account the expected profits and losses of credit granting and thereby better aligns the model developers' objectives with those of the lending company. It is based on the Expected Maximum Profit (EMP) measure and is used to find a trade-off between the expected losses - driven by the exposure of the loan and the loss given default - and the operational income given by the loan. Additionally, one of the major advantages of using the proposed measure is that it permits to calculate the optimal cutoff value, which is necessary for model implementation. To test the proposed approach, we use a dataset of loans granted by a government institution, and benchmarked the accuracy and monetary gain of using EMP, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve as measures for selecting model parameters, and for determining the respective cutoff values. The results show that our proposed profit-based classification measure outperforms the alternative approaches in terms of both accuracy and monetary value in the test set, and that it facilitates model deployment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Age is one of the most robust correlates of criminal behavior. Yet, explanations for this relationship are varied and conflicting. Developmental theories point to a multitude of sociological, psychological, and biological changes that occur during adolescence and adulthood. One prominent criminological perspective outlined by Gottfredson and Hirschi claims that age has a direct effect on crime, inexplicable from sociological and psychological variables. Despite the attention this claim has received, few direct empirical tests of it have been conducted. We use data from Pathways to Desistance, a longitudinal study of over 1,300 serious youthful offenders (85.8{\%} male, 40.1{\%} African-American, 34.3{\%} Hispanic, 21.0{\%} White), to test this claim. On average, youths were 16.5 years old at the initial interview and were followed for 7 years. We use multilevel longitudinal models to assess the extent to which the direct effects of age are reduced to statistical and substantive non-significance when constructs from a wide range of developmental and criminological theories are controlled. Unlike previous studies, we are able to control for changes across numerous realms emphasized within differing theoretical perspectives including social control (e.g., employment and marriage), procedural justice (e.g., perceptions of the legitimacy and fairness of the legal system), learning (e.g., gang membership and exposure to antisocial peers), strain (e.g., victimization and relationship breakup), psychosocial maturity (e.g., impulse control, self-regulation and moral disengagement), and rational choice (e.g., costs and rewards of crime). Assessed separately, these perspectives explain anywhere from 3{\%} (procedural justice) to 49{\%} (social learning) of the age-crime relationship. Together, changes in these constructs explain 69{\%} of the drop in crime from ages 15 to 25. We conclude that the relationship between age and crime in adolescence and early adulthood is largely explainable, though not entirely, attributable to multiple co-occurring developmental changes.},

Building on theories of representation and organized interest group behavior, this article argues that an increasingly punitive public has been a primary reason for this prolific expansion. To test this hypothesis, I generate a new over-time measure of the public's support for being tough on crime. The analysis suggests that, controlling for the crime rate, illegal drug use, inequality, and the party in power, since 1953 public opinion has been a fundamental determinant of changes in the incarceration rate. If the public's punitiveness had stopped rising in the mid-1970s, the results imply that there would have been approximately 20{\%} fewer incarcerations. Additionally, an analysis of congressional attention to criminal justice issues supports the argument that the public's attitudes have led, not followed, political elites.},

abstract = {• The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) was established during fiscal year 2001. Consistent with its statutory authority, during fiscal year 2002, OFDT began to increasingly assume certain program management responsibilities from the United States Marshals Service in order to better manage, plan, and coordinate federal detention resources. One of OFDT's primary areas of responsibility is to formulate and manage budgetary resources to support the federal criminal detention program. Accordingly, OFDT assumed primary responsibility for monitoring and projecting the size of future detention populations. The OFDT population projection methodology relies on micro-simulation techniques to track and forecast the experiences of individual offenders. Statistically, the accuracy of population projections is dependent upon the size of the population projected, the variability in the data series, and the length of the forecast interval. Experts generally consider correctional population projection models with a 2{\%} per annum error reliable. Unlike the projected of incarcerated populations, there is no clear and patent leading indicator of the number of persons to be admitted to the detention population. Absent a leading indicator, future arrest/booking cohorts have been estimated using time-series statistical techniques. Time-series models are based on the assumption that the past is prologue of the future. However, in an environment where the underlying trend can be substantially impacted by exogenous factors, time-series models will not produce reliable projections. In an effort to produce more reliable and valid projections of arrests/bookings, OFDT is working with the federal Bureau of Prisons and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys to (1) develop a methodology for measuring the impact of changes in law enforcement personnel on U.S. attorney workload, and (2) establish mechanisms for identifying and measuring the impact of U.S. attorney initiatives and changes in AUSA staffing levels on the detention population.},

The massive buildup in the size of the penal population has not been due to large scale changes in crime or criminality. Instead, a host of changes at the local, state, and federal levels with respect to law enforcement and penal policy are implicated in the expansion of the prison system. Such a dramatic change in criminal justice policy – and rapid growth in the prison system – raises ques-tions about its demographic effects. In this paper we combine data on the non-institutionalized population with data from surveys of inmates to exam-ine the demographic implications of the prison boom. The massive growth of the penal system is notable not only for its size, but also for its dispropor-tionate effects on minority and low-skill men. Results indicate that growth in the prison population over the past 30 years has been accompanied by low fertility, high morbidity due to communicable diseases, and high rates of involuntary population mobility among inmates and expansion of the prison system obscures the extent of racial inequality in demographic outcomes. We argue that the prison boom marks a " third demographic transition " representing growing institutional involvement in the lives of disadvantaged Americans.},

Plus s{\'{e}}v{\`{e}}res sur le plan p{\'{e}}nal, ces lois pourraient expliquer l'augmentation substantielle de la population carc{\'{e}}rale en 2012-2013, passant de 4 614 {\`{a}} 4 963 personnes. Toutefois, d{\`{e}}s 2013-2014 une stabilisation de la population moyenne quotidienne en institution (PMQI) se fait sentir o{\`{u}} la population atteint 5 100 personnes, soit une augmentation de 37 personnes en un an. Consid{\'{e}}rant le contexte actuel, les projections du pr{\'{e}}sent rapport indiquent une population carc{\'{e}}rale bien au-dessus des projections pass{\'{e}}es. Cependant, puisque nous observons une augmentation cyclique de la population carc{\'{e}}rale sur environ quatre ans, les analyses tiennent compte non seulement des effets des lois mentionn{\'{e}}es ci-dessus, mais aussi des p{\'{e}}riodes de relative stabilit{\'{e}} normalement observ{\'{e}}es. Les projections actuelles anticipent une population carc{\'{e}}rale minimale de 5 448 personnes en 2023-2024, soit une hausse de 6,8 {\%} par rapport aux donn{\'{e}}es r{\'{e}}elles de 2013-2014. Une hausse importante de la PMQI associ{\'{e}}e aux changements l{\'{e}}gislatifs d'emprisonnement avec sursis serait envisag{\'{e}}e. Toutefois, il semble que l'abolition de peines d'emprisonnement avec sursis ait eu une incidence plus importante sur la PMQI de la population intermittente. En effet, selon la tendance des derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es, la PMQI des personnes purgeant une peine discontinue pourrait atteindre 698 personnes en 2023-2024, soit une augmentation de 76,3 {\%}.},

@article{Blumstein,
abstract = {T he excellent and broad-ranging article by Durlauf and Nagin (2011, this issue) represents a wise policy document that builds on their excellent previous article (Durlauf and Nagin, in press), which provided a strong analysis of the issue of factors contributing to deterrence of offending. In this review, I build on what I see as the strongest points of their article, particularly their contrast of the relative importance of certainty and severity and their highlighting of certainty over severity. That observation, which many would have difficulty challenging today as the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, strongly argues for reduction of severity as reflected in the sentences imposed on convicted offenders. In exchange, it argues for using the resources thereby made available for increasing the certainty of punishment to strengthen the deterrent effect. Their primary emphasis is on providing resources to policing as a means of increasing certainty of arrest. This is certainly one important approach to using the deterrent sanction more effectively. But it also opens the door to using those resources in other ways that could contribute to less crime, thereby achieving their fundamental goal of less imprisonment (shorter sentences) and less crime: increasing certainty or pursuing other actions enabled by those resources to reduce crime. In this essay, I would like to pick up on Durlauf and Nagin's (2011) basic objectives and discuss other approaches that should be considered as part of the policy agenda. It may well be that more and stronger policing is the best way to use those resources, but that case is far less clear than the desirability of reducing severity. Then, there should be examination in a broader systems context of the costs and benefits of a variety of other means of generating less crime. Deterrence Daniel S. Nagin has been an outstanding and admirably balanced scholar of the issue of deterrence. His initial work in the field as the lead contributor on deterrence to a National Academy of Sciences volume on deterrence and incapacitation (Blumstein, Cohen and Nagin, 1978) provided a strong challenge to work by Isaac Ehrlich (1973, 1975) that claimed to provide evidence of the deterrent effect of incarceration and especially of capital punishment, with a claim that each execution would save eight lives. The basic thrust of the challenges were associated with simultaneity of incarceration affecting crime, but also crime affecting incarceration, an issue of endogeneity not adequately addressed in Ehrlich's work. Nagin has since published a variety of papers on deterrence, including attention to the role of perception of sanction risk that goes beyond the normal statistical analysis that characterizes most economic analyses of deterrence. He has been called on by Crime and Justice (Nagin, 1998) to provide central essays on the status of deterrence research. In this work, he has been particularly balanced in his treatment of the issue, in contrast to much of the economic analyses that argue strongly for their estimates of a deterrent effect, and to recognize the challenges of those estimates (see, e.g., Donohue and Wolfers, 2005), which point out their weaknesses. In this article by Durlauf and Nagin (2011), Nagin's strengths have been augmented by an excellent econometrician, Steven N. Durlauf, who has done his own work assessing regression analyses used to estimate deterrent effects and has teamed with Nagin to assess the severity–certainty trade-off in their forthcoming chapter and in the development of this article to develop the policy implications of that work. The Third Component of Deterrence Even though most discussions of deterrence focus on certainty and severity, it has been recognized that there is a third component in " celerity, " the speediness of the imposition of the punishment, with recognition that a speedy imposition strengthens the deterrent effect. This is particularly applicable in the context of specific deterrence, the deterrence of the individual being punished, in contrast to general deterrence that reflects a concern for the broader symbolic message associated with deterrence. The issue of celerity has been brought to attention in recent years by a program targeted at individuals with substance-abuse problems. Project HOPE in Hawaii was directed at offenders whose drug dependency was the major cause of their criminal activity. They were put on probation with a requirement to call a central office daily; then, on a randomly chosen day each week, they would be required to come in for a drug test. If they failed that test, they would be sent to jail immediately but for a very short sentence of one or a few days; that sentence would increase slowly for each successive failure. That program saw major reductions of more than 50{\%} in subsequent arrests and detected drug use compared with a control group that was given normal probation (Hawken and Kleiman, 2009).},

abstract = {One of the most distressing and troublesome aspects of the opera-tion of the criminal justice system in the United States is the severe dis-proportionality between blacks and whites in the composition of prison populations. Although blacks comprise roughly one-eighth of the popu-lation, they represent about one-half of the prison population. Thus, the race-specific incarceration rates (the ratio of prisoners to population within each racial group) are grossly disproportionate. This dispropor-tionality has been a source of major concern, largely because it suggests the possibility of gross injustice in the criminal justice system. The racial differences in imprisonment are reflected in Table 1, which presents demographic-specific incarceration rates (in units of pris-oners per 100,000 persons within each indicated demographic group) in state prisons (not including federal prisons or local jails) for blacks and whites and their total.I This table highlights the great sensitivity of},

abstract = {T he nation's local jail authorities supervised an estimated 731,570 confined inmates at yearend 2013 (table 1). The number of confined inmates includes those who were unconvicted and awaiting court action on a current charge, convicted offenders awaiting sentencing, and sentenced offenders. Jail authorities also supervised about 9,670 persons who were serving a weekend-only sentence on the weekend prior to December 31, 2013. In addition, jail authorities supervised about 46,770 persons under community supervision through programs such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, day reporting, and work programs at yearend 2013. The population excludes persons supervised by a probation or parole agency. Based on a complete enumeration of all locally operated jails, the 2013 Census of Jails, which was collected through the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program's Annual Summary on Inmates Under Jail Jurisdiction, gathered facility-level information on the number of confined and nonconfined jail inmates. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1999, 2005, and 2006. In years between census collections, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected data from a sample of local jails to estimate the number and composition of inmates in local jails nationwide. This report uses the jail information from the 1999, 2006, and 2013 censuses to provide state and national level estimates and to examine changes in the number of inmates held, characteristics of jail inmates, the number of admissions, jail capacity to hold inmates, and jail staffing. By combining data from the census and annual surveys in noncensus years, BJS tracked the size and composition of local jails in the United States. After a surge from 1999 to 2008, the confined inmate population declined in local jails from midyear 2008 to yearend 2013 (table 2). The number of inmates confined in local jails increased 23{\%} between 1999 (605,943) and 2006 (748,197). Since 2006, the inmate population declined by 2.2{\%} (table 3).},

abstract = {After decades of steady expansion, state prison populations declined in recent years for the first time since 1972. Though the size of the decrease was small, it masks substantial state heterogeneity. This article investigates variation in state-level incarceration rates from 1980 through 2013, examining the factors associated with the rise and decline in prison populations. We find evidence for four key stories in explaining the prison decline: crime, budgets, politics, and inequality. Many of these relationships are consistent across decades, including the role of racial composition, violent crime, and Republican political dominance. In contrast, states' fiscal capacity and economic inequality became more important after 2000. This research emphasizes the importance of examining changes over time in the correlates of incarceration growth and decline and represents the first effort to systematically understand the recent reversal in the trajectory of incarceration practices in the United States.},

Using geographic information systems (GIS) and logistic regression modeling, our results showed that the likelihood of reincarceration was increased with male gender, drug involvement, offense type, and living in areas with high rates of recidivism. Older offenders and those convicted of violent or drug offenses were less likely to be reincarcerated. For violent offenders, drug involvement, age, and spatial contagion were particular risk factors for reincarceration.

It has been made relevant by recent criminological theories, made possible by recent information technologies including geographic information systems (GIS), and made desirable because of innovative crime management practices. While focused primarily on the police component of the criminal justice system, the six papers provide a wide range of forecasting settings and models including UK and US jurisdictions, long- and short-term horizons, univariate and multivariate methods, and fixed boundary versus ad hoc spatial cluster areal units for the space and time series data.

A major result, expected for the small-scale data of this problem, is that average crime count by precinct is the major determinant of forecast accuracy. A fixed-effects regression model of absolute percent forecast error shows that such counts need to be on the order of 30 or more to achieve accuracy of 20{\%} absolute forecast error or less. A second major result is that practically any model-based forecasting approach is vastly more accurate than current police practices.

abstract = {In this study we propose several mathematical models for describing the behavior of crime-related systems. In the first part is presented a simple model for describing and measuring crime systems with recidivism. This model may be used in estimating the quantitative effects of alternative policies on crime rates. An important factor not recognized by the model is deterrence. One derivative of the mathematical analyses is a proposed method for measuring the relative severity of sentencing in a given system. The second part of the paper deals with the criminal population as a whole, trying to bring into account the non-stationary behavior of the system. This study should be regarded as a preliminary attempt to develop elementary mathematical models fitting crime systems. Some of the assumptions do not have substantial direct support by data.},

This study has attempted to relate the primary system goal of crime control to a set of policy alternatives distributed over each criminal justice sector. Specifically, a simulation model based on the techniques of “industrial dynamics” was developed to evaluate combinations of the following policies: speedy trial, no plea bargaining, and restricted bail. Data obtained from the District of Columbia's criminal justice agencies were used to validate the model. The results of the analysis indicate that the system is basically insensitive to small perturbations, but is susceptible to disruption from large changes in input and procedure. Under the given set of assumptions, continuation of current practices will lead to a gradual deterioration in performance that can only be stemmed by large expenditures on manpower and facilities.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the applications of operations research and management science (OR/MS) to problems of crime and justice. The chapter describes how OR/MS has been used in studying crime and criminal justice. The correctional system has several goals: deterrence, education, retribution, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. The models relating to incapacitation are explored. The recidivism of an offender, his/her continuing to commit crimes, is a crucial factor in criminal career research. Deterrence is the reduction in criminal activity by the general public attributable to a given intervention. It is not associated with specific individuals, so it cannot be measured by tracing offenders' careers. Another area of importance to prison administrators is the projection of future populations of offenders. Operations research has also been used to study crime and how the police react to it. Problems related to juries investigated using operations research include the elimination of intentional bias in empaneling juries; considerations related to increasing bias in a jury by using peremptory challenges; and studies relating to the reduction of juror waiting time and the cost of empaneling juries. The systematic, quantitative thinking exemplified by these approaches to problem-solving has been very effective in helping to improve the administration of criminal justice.},

Increases in crime-prone groups in the population were not found to be associated with increased prison admission rates. Admission rates for the demographically disaggregated groups changed over time, and the pattern of changes varied depending upon the group examined. There was a relatively small growth in the prison population from 1975 to 1980, and over eighty-five percent of the growth could be explained by demographic changes. In contrast, from 1980 to 1983 there was substantial growth in the prison population, yet only 6.7 percent of the growth could be attributed to demographic shifts. Possible reasons for the pattern of changes found for the different age, race, and sex groups and for the large admission rate increases in the early 1980s are discussed.},

The plan is to make a regression-based estimate for 2010, then compare that to the 2010 Census data when it comes out, and have some rough idea of what level of error should be expected for future, annual estimates.},

@article{Raphael2009,
abstract = {Between 1975 and 2007, the American incarceration rate increased nearly fivefold, a historic increase that puts the United States in a league of its own among advanced economies. We incarcerate more people today than we ever have, and we stand out as the nation that most frequently uses incarceration to punish those who break the law. What factors explain the dramatic rise in incarceration rates in such a short period of time? In Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? Steven Raphael and Michael A. Stoll analyze the shocking expansion of America s prison system and illustrate the pressing need to rethink mass incarceration in this country. Raphael and Stoll carefully evaluate changes in crime patterns, enforcement practices and sentencing laws to reach a sobering conclusion: So many Americans are in prison today because we have chosen, through our public policies, to put them there. They dispel the notion that a rise in crime rates fueled the incarceration surge; in fact, crime rates have steadily declined to all-time lows. There is also little evidence for other factors commonly offered to explain the prison boom, such as the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill since the 1950s, changing demographics, or the crack-cocaine epidemic. By contrast, Raphael and Stoll demonstrate that legislative changes to a relatively small set of sentencing policies explain nearly all prison growth since the 1980s. So-called tough on crime laws, including mandatory minimum penalties and repeat offender statutes, have increased the propensity to punish more offenders with lengthier prison sentences. Raphael and Stoll argue that the high-incarceration regime has inflicted broad social costs, particularly among minority communities, who form a disproportionate share of the incarcerated population. Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? ends with a powerful plea to consider alternative crime control strategies, such as expanded policing, drug court programs, and sentencing law reform, which together can end our addiction to incarceration and still preserve public safety. As states confront the budgetary and social costs of the incarceration boom, Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? provides a revealing and accessible guide to the policies that created the era of mass incarceration and what we can do now to end it.},

These models determine in stochastic terms the ensuing prison population size that occurs after perturbations in the values of certain parameters have been made. The parameters are: the average inmate admission rate, the average time of incarceration, the elapsed time, and the initial number of inmates. The models' quantitative results are reported in the form of probabilities of intervals of two standard deviations about the mean of prison population size. Because of the models used, the prison population size is not normally distributed, nevertheless, it is shown that this random variable can be considered approximately normally distributed. ?? 1991.},

We outline the problems with this approach, attempt to reanalyze the widely divergent lambdas derived in past research, and make adjustments necessary to use lambdas for estimating the incapacitation impact. The result is an uncertain estimate of 16 to 25 index crimes averted per year per each additional prisoner. We argue that regression analysis can provide a better estimate of the impact of prison population growth. Applying the Granger test to pooled state data over 19 years, we found that prison population growth leads to lower crime rates but that crime rate changes have little or no short-term impact on prison population growth. Next we regressed crime rates on prison population and conclude that, on average, at least 17 index crimes are averted per additional prisoner. The impact is limited mainly to property crime.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the past several decades, the U.S. prison system has witnessed a steady and persistent increase in the ages of prison populations. Given the additional costs and burdens placed on prisons as they house older inmates, this aging trend has generated intense interest among policy makers and academics who seek to understand why prison populations are getting older. OBJECTIVE: This article presents a method for evaluating drivers influencing the change in age distributions among prisoners. METHOD: We define a methodological approach and demonstrate its application using prison data from four states reporting to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Corrections Reporting Program. RESULTS: We find that since 2000, the primary driver of overall growth in the elderly populations in prison (defined as inmates over 50) is the increasing admission age of offenders entering prison. Moreover, changes in offense mix and sentence length/time served over the last decade have had significantly less influence on the age composition of prison populations. We also find that the impact of explanatory factors varies across states and offense types. For example, prison admission and exit rates explain much of the change in elderly drug offenders in New York, but not elderly violent offenders, where admission age plays a much stronger explanatory role. CONCLUSION: Our analysis offers an effective demonstration that supports the use of this method as an important and informative first step toward understanding components of change that affect the problem of prison aging.},

Persons convicted of homicide, serious assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft received longer sentences. The exceptions were robbery and rape. Limited access to uniform national crime statistics and time-series data on crime-related socioeconomic factors makes explaining these trends difficult. Differences in the responses of states and territories to crime and lack of uniform court and prison statistics make identification of the factors underlying the risk of offending complicated. The risk of punishment seems to be negatively associated with crime rates, but trying to explain this apparent relationship is adventurous.

abstract = {State and federal incarceration rates grew by over 200 percent between 1980 and 1996. The dominant factor is drug offending, which grew by ten times, followed by assault and sexual assault. The growth can be partitioned among four stages: offending rates; arrests per offense; commitments to prison per arrest; and time served in prison, including time served on parole recommitments. The growth in incarceration for drugs is driven most strongly by growth in arrest rates, then by commitments per arrest; there is some increase in time served, but only in the federal system. For other offenses, there are no changes in arrests per reported offense and a net decline in offending rates. Over the full period, the growth in state incarceration for nondrug offenses is attributable entirely to sentencing increases: 42 percent to commitments per arrest and 58 percent to time-served increases. Recently, new court commitments and parole violations have flattened out; the dominant contributor to current growth for all the offenses examined is time served. Incarceration rates rose faster for women (364 percent) and minorities (184 percent for African Americans and 235 percent for Hispanics) than for men (195 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (164 percent).},

I address these issues and undertake such an analysis using a pooled state-level analysis covering the years 1980–1995. Results suggest that the growth in prison populations has little to do with changes in crime rates or government response to citizen attitudes.

abstract = {Despite considerable theoretical interest, little is known about the political determinants of punishment. This study uses a pooled time-series design to fill this gap by examining political and other determinants of state imprisonment rates. The presence of Republican elected officials is used to assess the strength of the law-and-order political party. Ethnic threat theories suggest that imprisonments will be more likely in jurisdictions with the most blacks or Hispanics, while economic threat theories suggest that the imprisoned population will be greater where economic stratification is most pronounced. After controlling for social disorganization, religious fundamentalism, political conservatism, and violent crimes, the results show that Republican strength and minority threat lead to higher imprisonment rates. Statistical interactions support predictions that these relationships became stronger after greater Republican stress on law and order. The latter findings confirm theoret)},

Por lo tanto y para concretar esta$\backslash$nintenci�n, se seleccion� c�mo actor representativo al Instituto Nacional Penitenciario y$\backslash$nCarcelario ?INPEC-, en virtud a que esta Instituci�n tiene entre sus responsabilidades, la$\backslash$nadministraci�n de la pena, el desarrollo del proceso de resocializaci�n y hasta el a�o 2012$\backslash$ntuvo la rector�a exclusiva en materia sanitaria.$\backslash$nEn este marco y partiendo del enfoque de vigilancia en salud p�blica, se procedi� al$\backslash$nreconocimiento sanitario bajo un dise�o de car�cter descriptivo, que posibilit� caracterizar las$\backslash$nrealidades sociodemogr�ficas, epidemiol�gicas, higi�nico-sanitarias e institucionales que$\backslash$npresentaba el INPEC.$\backslash$nBajo este rigor y una vez finalizado este reconocimiento, se procedi� a medir las 11 funciones$\backslash$nesenciales, mediante el acceso a sus tres niveles de organizaci�n territorial, contando para ello,$\backslash$ncon los aportes de 8 funcionarios relacionados con la gesti�n de la salud p�blica intramural.$\backslash$nEn este respecto, la medici�n se desarroll� en la Direcci�n General, en la Direcci�n Regional$\backslash$nCentral y en el Complejo Metropolitano de Bogot�-COMEB ?La Picota?.
